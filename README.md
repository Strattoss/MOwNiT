This repository contains files used and exercises done during Computational Methods in Science and Technology course (in Polish: Metody Obliczeniowe w Nauce i Technice). All labs were handed in as Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and HTML (.html) files. They contain a lot of plots, tables and animations, so I encourage you to look at them.
